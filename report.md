# High Issues

## H-1: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 60](src/Dapper.sol#L60)

	State is changed at: `uint256 id = ++stakeId`, `stakeDetails[id] = newStake`
	```solidity
	        uint256 shares = Vault(yieldVaultAddress).deposit(netAmount, address(this));
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 2](src/Dapper.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/MockERC20.sol [Line: 1](src/MockERC20.sol#L1)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 2](src/Vault.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-2: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 40](src/Dapper.sol#L40)

	```solidity
	        yieldVaultAddress = _yieldVaultAddress;
	```

- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 41](src/Dapper.sol#L41)

	```solidity
	        beneficiaryVault = new Vault(_depositToken, "Dapper Beneficiary Vault Token", "bDAP");
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 2](src/Dapper.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/MockERC20.sol [Line: 1](src/MockERC20.sol#L1)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 2](src/Vault.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Large Numeric Literal

Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation.Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Dapper.sol [Line: 48](src/Dapper.sol#L48)

	```solidity
	        uint256 interestPaid = Math.mulDiv(amount, lockDuration * interestRateBps, 10000 * 365 days);
	```

</details>



## L-5: Local Variable Shadows State Variable

Rename the local variable that shadows another state variable.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Vault.sol [Line: 7](src/Vault.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    constructor(address _depositToken, string memory _name, string memory _symbol) ERC20(_name, _symbol) ERC4626(IERC20(_depositToken)) {}
	```

</details>



## L-6: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

	```solidity
